JS-RPG : 2011
=============

A turn by turn RPG developped in js to discover JS.
I stopped this project when I failed to give it an online aspect. (Didn't knew much about php at the time)

**Interesting points :**
- Algorithm for the personnage view (inspired by nethack)
- Inventory system managed with mouse

To play
-------

- moving         : arrows
- pick up object : espace
- drop object    : mouse
- equip object   : mouse
